# Troubleshooting

Concrete fixes for concrete problems. Each entry names a symptom, explains the likely cause in a sentence, and gives you the fix. If you don't see your issue here, the [FAQ](faq.md) may help, and the [Discord](https://discord.gg/YctCnvvshC) definitely will.

## Installation and setup

### `openspec: command not found`

The CLI isn't installed, or your shell can't find it. Install it globally and check:

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
openspec --version
```

If it installed but still isn't found, your global npm bin directory probably isn't on your `PATH`. Run `npm bin -g` to see where global binaries live, and make sure that path is in your shell profile.

### "Requires Node.js 20.19.0 or higher"

OpenSpec runs on Node 20.19.0+. Check your version and upgrade if needed:

```bash
node --version
```

If you use bun to install OpenSpec, note that OpenSpec still *runs* on Node, so you need Node 20.19.0+ available on your `PATH` regardless. See [Installation](installation.md).

### `openspec init` didn't configure my AI tool

Init asks which tools to set up. If you skipped your tool or want to add another, just run it again, or use the non-interactive form:

```bash
openspec init --tools claude,cursor
```

The full list of tool IDs is in [Supported Tools](supported-tools.md). Use `--tools all` for everything, `--tools none` to skip tool setup.

## Commands don't show up

If `/opsx:propose` (or your tool's equivalent) doesn't appear or doesn't do anything, work down this list. They're ordered fastest-to-check first.

1. **You may be in the wrong place.** Slash commands go in your AI assistant's chat, not your terminal. If you typed `/opsx:propose` into your shell, that's the issue. See [How Commands Work](how-commands-work.md).

2. **Regenerate the files.** From your project root:

   ```bash
   openspec update
   ```

   This rewrites the skill and command files for every tool you've configured.

3. **Restart your assistant.** Most tools scan for skills and commands at startup. A fresh window often does it.

4. **Confirm the files exist.** For Claude Code, check that `.claude/skills/` contains `openspec-*` folders. Other tools use their own directories, all listed in [Supported Tools](supported-tools.md).

5. **Check you initialized this project.** Skills are written per project. If you cloned a repo or switched folders, run `openspec init` (or `openspec update`) there.

6. **Confirm your tool supports command files.** A few tools (Kimi CLI, Trae, ForgeCode, Mistral Vibe) don't get generated `opsx-*` command files; they use skill-based invocations instead. The forms differ per tool: see [Supported Tools](supported-tools.md) and [How Commands Work](how-commands-work.md#slash-command-syntax-by-tool).

## Working with changes

### "Change not found"

The command couldn't tell which change you meant. Name it explicitly, or check what exists:

```bash
openspec list                    # see active changes
/opsx:apply add-dark-mode        # name the change in chat
```

Also confirm you're in the right project directory.

### "No artifacts ready"

Every artifact is either already created or blocked waiting on a dependency. See what's blocking:

```bash
openspec status --change <name>
```

Then create the missing dependency first. Remember the order: proposal enables specs and design; specs and design together enable tasks.

### `openspec validate` reports warnings or errors

Validation checks your specs and changes for structural problems. Read the message: it names the file and the issue.

```bash
openspec validate <name>           # validate one item
openspec validate --all            # validate everything
openspec validate --all --strict   # stricter checks, good for CI
```

Common causes are a missing required section (like a spec with no scenarios) or a malformed delta header. Fix the file and re-run. The [CLI reference](cli.md#openspec-validate) documents the output format.

### The AI created incomplete or wrong artifacts

The AI didn't have enough context. A few levers help:

- Add project context in `openspec/config.yaml` so your stack and conventions are injected into every request. See [Customization](customization.md#project-configuration).
- Add per-artifact `rules:` for guidance that only applies to, say, specs.
- Give a more detailed description when you propose.
- Use the expanded `/opsx:continue` to create one artifact at a time and review each, instead of `/opsx:ff` doing them all at once.

### Archive won't finish, or warns about incomplete tasks

Archive won't *block* on incomplete tasks, but it warns you, because archiving usually means the work is done. If tasks remain on purpose (you're filing a partial change), proceed. Otherwise finish the tasks first. Archive will also offer to sync your delta specs into the main specs if you haven't synced yet; say yes unless you have a reason not to.

## Configuration

### My `config.yaml` isn't being applied

Three usual suspects:

1. **Wrong filename.** It must be `openspec/config.yaml`, not `.yml`.
2. **Invalid YAML.** Run it through any YAML validator; the CLI also reports syntax errors with line numbers.
3. **You expected a restart.** You don't need one. Config changes take effect immediately.

### "Unknown artifact ID in rules: X"

A key under `rules:` doesn't match any artifact in your schema. For the default `spec-driven` schema the valid IDs are `proposal`, `specs`, `design`, `tasks`. To see the IDs for any schema:

```bash
openspec schemas --json
```

### "Context too large"

The `context:` field is capped at 50KB, on purpose, because it's injected into every request. Summarize it, or link out to longer docs instead of pasting them. Lean context also produces better, faster results.

### "Schema not found"

The schema name you referenced doesn't exist. List what's available and check spelling:

```bash
openspec schemas                    # list available schemas
openspec schema which <name>        # see where a schema resolves from
openspec schema init <name>         # create a custom one
```

See [Customization](customization.md#custom-schemas).

## Migration from the legacy workflow

### "Legacy files detected in non-interactive mode"

You're in CI or a non-interactive shell, and OpenSpec found old files to clean up but can't prompt you. Approve automatically:

```bash
openspec init --force
```

### Commands didn't appear after migrating

Restart your IDE. Skills are detected at startup. If they still don't appear, run `openspec update` and check the file locations in [Supported Tools](supported-tools.md).

### My old `project.md` wasn't migrated

That's intentional. OpenSpec never deletes `project.md` automatically because it may hold context you wrote. Move the useful parts into `config.yaml`'s `context:` section, then delete it yourself. The [Migration Guide](migration-guide.md#migrating-projectmd-to-configyaml) walks through this, including a prompt you can hand to your AI to do the distilling.

## Still stuck?

- **Discord:** [discord.gg/YctCnvvshC](https://discord.gg/YctCnvvshC)
- **GitHub Issues:** [github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/issues](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/issues)
- **From your terminal:** `openspec feedback "what went wrong"` opens an issue for you.

When you report a problem, include your OpenSpec version (`openspec --version`), your Node version (`node --version`), your AI tool, and the exact command and output. It makes help much faster.
