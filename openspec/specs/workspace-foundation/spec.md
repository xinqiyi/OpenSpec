# workspace-foundation Specification

## Purpose
Define the product and storage foundation for OpenSpec coordination workspaces,
including workspace identity, shared versus local state, managed storage,
registry behavior, stable link names, and repo ownership boundaries.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Recognizable Workspace Home
OpenSpec SHALL give users and agents a recognizable workspace home for cross-repo planning.

#### Scenario: Planning across linked repos or folders
- **WHEN** a user creates an OpenSpec workspace for repos or folders they plan across
- **THEN** the workspace SHALL provide a durable planning home
- **AND** the workspace SHALL be able to hold multiple changes over time

#### Scenario: Working from inside a workspace
- **GIVEN** a user runs OpenSpec from a workspace folder or one of its subdirectories
- **WHEN** OpenSpec resolves the current workspace
- **THEN** it SHALL identify the workspace location
- **AND** it SHALL use the workspace location's `changes/` directory as the workspace planning area

#### Scenario: Avoiding accidental workspace mode
- **GIVEN** a directory has `changes/` but is not an OpenSpec workspace
- **WHEN** OpenSpec resolves the current workspace
- **THEN** it SHALL avoid treating that directory as a workspace
- **AND** it SHALL enter workspace mode only when the workspace identity file is present

### Requirement: Stable Workspace Name
OpenSpec SHALL use one kebab-case workspace name across workspace identity, managed storage, and the local registry.

#### Scenario: Using one workspace name
- **WHEN** OpenSpec creates or records a managed workspace
- **THEN** the workspace name SHALL be stored in `.openspec-workspace/view.yaml`
- **AND** the same name SHALL be used as the default managed workspace folder name
- **AND** the same name SHALL be used as the local registry name

#### Scenario: Rejecting invalid workspace names
- **WHEN** OpenSpec accepts a workspace name
- **THEN** it SHALL require kebab-case names using lowercase letters, numbers, and single hyphen separators
- **AND** it SHALL reject empty names, dot names, names with leading or trailing hyphens, names with repeated hyphens, uppercase letters, spaces, underscores, dots, and path separators
- **AND** setup flows SHALL report OS-level folder creation failures clearly

### Requirement: Dedicated Workspace Identity
OpenSpec SHALL distinguish a coordination workspace from a repo-local OpenSpec project.

#### Scenario: Reading workspace identity
- **WHEN** OpenSpec reads or writes workspace identity and workspace state
- **THEN** it SHALL use `.openspec-workspace/`

#### Scenario: Preserving repo-local OpenSpec projects
- **GIVEN** a repo-local OpenSpec project uses `openspec/`
- **WHEN** that repo is linked to a workspace
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL continue treating `openspec/` as that repo's local OpenSpec directory
- **AND** workspace planning SHALL remain anchored in the workspace folder

#### Scenario: Avoiding repo-local initialization in the workspace folder
- **WHEN** a user is working from an OpenSpec workspace folder
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL treat that folder as a workspace coordination surface
- **AND** users SHALL not need to initialize a repo-local `openspec/` project inside the workspace folder

### Requirement: Safe Workspace Sharing
OpenSpec SHALL keep shared workspace information separate from local machine paths.

#### Scenario: Sharing workspace planning
- **WHEN** a workspace is shared with another user or machine
- **THEN** shared workspace information SHALL include portable workspace identity and stable link names
- **AND** it SHALL not require another user to reuse the original user's absolute checkout paths

#### Scenario: Keeping checkout paths local
- **WHEN** OpenSpec stores local paths for a workspace
- **THEN** those paths SHALL be treated as local to the current machine and runtime
- **AND** another machine MAY map the same link names to different local paths

#### Scenario: Preserving runtime-local paths
- **WHEN** OpenSpec reads or writes machine-local path state
- **THEN** it SHALL preserve path strings valid for the current runtime
- **AND** it SHALL support native Windows paths and WSL2/Linux paths as local state values

#### Scenario: Keeping managed workspace view state local
- **WHEN** OpenSpec creates a managed workspace
- **THEN** it SHALL write `.openspec-workspace/view.yaml` as private local view state
- **AND** the file SHALL preserve stable link names and local path values for the current machine

### Requirement: Standard Workspace Location
OpenSpec SHALL use a standard location for OpenSpec-managed workspaces without asking most users to choose one.

#### Scenario: Using the standard workspace location
- **WHEN** OpenSpec needs the location for OpenSpec-managed workspaces
- **THEN** it SHALL use `<global-data-dir>/workspaces`
- **AND** `<global-data-dir>` SHALL follow existing OpenSpec XDG and platform data directory behavior

#### Scenario: Avoiding workspace-specific storage overrides
- **WHEN** OpenSpec resolves the location for OpenSpec-managed workspaces
- **THEN** it SHALL not use a workspace-specific environment variable, command, or configuration setting in this slice
- **AND** managed workspace storage SHALL remain under `<global-data-dir>/workspaces`

#### Scenario: Running from native Windows
- **WHEN** OpenSpec runs from native Windows shells such as PowerShell
- **AND** `XDG_DATA_HOME` is not set
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL store managed workspaces under the Windows global data location
- **AND** paths SHALL follow native Windows path behavior

#### Scenario: Running from WSL2
- **WHEN** OpenSpec runs from WSL2
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL store managed workspaces under the Linux/XDG data location inside WSL
- **AND** paths SHALL follow Linux path behavior inside WSL

#### Scenario: Using the workspace location automatically
- **WHEN** OpenSpec creates or resolves OpenSpec-managed workspaces in later workflows
- **THEN** it SHALL use the resolved workspace location by default
- **AND** users SHALL be able to follow the normal workspace flow without choosing a storage location

#### Scenario: Showing the workspace location
- **WHEN** OpenSpec creates a workspace in the standard workspace location
- **THEN** it SHALL report the workspace location to the user
- **AND** it SHALL not hide where planning files were created

#### Scenario: Staying in the current runtime
- **WHEN** OpenSpec resolves workspace locations or local repo paths
- **THEN** it SHALL interpret paths for the runtime running OpenSpec
- **AND** Windows, UNC WSL, and WSL mount paths SHALL remain explicit user-provided paths

### Requirement: Local Workspace Registry
OpenSpec SHALL keep a lightweight local registry of known workspaces on the current machine.

#### Scenario: Recording known workspaces
- **WHEN** OpenSpec creates or learns about a managed workspace
- **THEN** it SHALL be able to record the workspace name and location in a local registry
- **AND** the registry SHALL be machine-local state

#### Scenario: Keeping workspace folders authoritative
- **WHEN** OpenSpec reads workspace details
- **THEN** each workspace folder's `.openspec-workspace/view.yaml` SHALL remain the source of truth for that workspace
- **AND** the local registry SHALL act only as an index of known workspace locations

#### Scenario: Finding workspaces from anywhere
- **WHEN** a later workspace command runs outside a workspace directory
- **THEN** OpenSpec MAY use the local registry to find known workspaces
- **AND** commands that need one workspace MAY use the registry to support an interactive picker

### Requirement: Stable Link Names
OpenSpec SHALL use stable folder-style link names to refer to repos and folders in workspace planning.

#### Scenario: Referring to a repo or folder in workspace planning
- **WHEN** workspace state or later workspace planning artifacts refer to a linked repo or folder
- **THEN** they SHALL use the stable link name
- **AND** the same link name SHALL remain valid even when local checkout paths differ

#### Scenario: Reusing link names across machines
- **WHEN** a workspace is used on another machine
- **THEN** link names SHALL remain stable
- **AND** local checkout paths MAY differ on that machine

#### Scenario: Rejecting invalid link names
- **WHEN** OpenSpec accepts a workspace link name
- **THEN** it SHALL reject empty names, `.` or `..`, and names containing path separators
- **AND** link names SHALL be unique within the workspace
- **AND** link names SHALL not be required to use workspace-name kebab-case

### Requirement: Linked Repos And Folders
OpenSpec SHALL allow workspace planning to include linked repos and folders before they have repo-local OpenSpec state.

#### Scenario: Planning with a repo that has not adopted OpenSpec
- **WHEN** a workspace links a repo path that does not yet contain repo-local `openspec/`
- **THEN** the repo SHALL still be available for workspace-level planning
- **AND** implementation readiness MAY be handled by a later workflow

#### Scenario: Planning across monorepo folders
- **WHEN** planning spans multiple packages, services, apps, or directories inside one monorepo
- **THEN** the workspace SHALL be able to link those folders separately
- **AND** each folder SHALL not need its own repo-local `openspec/` directory to participate in workspace planning

#### Scenario: Treating repos and folders consistently
- **WHEN** a workspace plan includes both separate repos and folders inside a monorepo
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL use the same planning model for both
- **AND** users SHALL not need to create different kinds of workspace plans for multi-repo and monorepo changes

#### Scenario: Recording links without changing targets
- **WHEN** OpenSpec records a link between a workspace and a local repo or folder
- **THEN** it SHALL store the link in workspace state
- **AND** it SHALL not create, copy, move, initialize, or edit files inside the linked repo or folder

### Requirement: Planning Before Implementation
OpenSpec SHALL treat workspace creation and detection as planning setup, not implementation.

#### Scenario: Creating or detecting a workspace
- **WHEN** a workspace exists
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL treat it as a place for workspace-level planning
- **AND** repo implementation files SHALL remain unchanged until an explicit implementation workflow runs

#### Scenario: Deferring repo implementation
- **WHEN** repo-local implementation, apply, verify, or archive behavior is needed
- **THEN** that behavior SHALL require an explicit later workspace workflow

### Requirement: Repo Ownership Boundaries
OpenSpec SHALL keep repo ownership legible when planning happens in a workspace.

#### Scenario: Planning across owned repos
- **WHEN** a workspace plan refers to behavior owned by a repo or source area
- **THEN** that owner SHALL remain the home for canonical specs and implementation work
- **AND** the workspace SHALL make the cross-boundary plan visible without taking ownership away from that owner

#### Scenario: Drafting before ownership is clear
- **WHEN** cross-repo behavior is still being explored and ownership is not clear
- **THEN** the workspace MAY hold planning notes or draft behavior
- **AND** those drafts SHALL remain distinguishable from canonical repo-owned specs

### Requirement: Workspace Preferred Opener State
OpenSpec SHALL store a workspace's preferred opener in machine-local workspace state when the user explicitly chooses one.

#### Scenario: Recording an interactive setup opener choice
- **WHEN** an interactive user chooses a preferred opener during `openspec workspace setup`
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL record the opener in `.openspec-workspace/view.yaml`
- **AND** the stored value SHALL use a structured `preferred_opener` object with `kind` and `id`

#### Scenario: Recording a non-interactive setup opener choice
- **WHEN** a non-interactive user runs `openspec workspace setup --no-interactive --opener codex`
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL record `preferred_opener.kind` as `agent`
- **AND** it SHALL record `preferred_opener.id` as `codex`

#### Scenario: Leaving opener unset during non-interactive setup
- **WHEN** a non-interactive user runs `openspec workspace setup --no-interactive` with opener selection omitted
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL leave the workspace preferred opener unset
- **AND** the unset state SHALL allow `workspace open` to prompt later

#### Scenario: Supported preferred opener values
- **WHEN** OpenSpec accepts a preferred opener value
- **THEN** it SHALL accept `codex`, `claude`, `github-copilot`, and `editor`
- **AND** it SHALL map `editor` to `kind: editor` and `id: vscode`
- **AND** it SHALL map agent values to `kind: agent` and the matching agent `id`

#### Scenario: Ordering setup opener choices
- **WHEN** interactive setup displays opener choices
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL show all supported openers
- **AND** it SHALL order openers with detected executables before unavailable openers
- **AND** unavailable openers SHALL remain visible with an availability note

### Requirement: Maintained Workspace Open Surface
OpenSpec SHALL maintain files that make a workspace directly openable after setup and link changes.

#### Scenario: Creating the open surface during setup
- **WHEN** `openspec workspace setup` creates a workspace
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL create or refresh `AGENTS.md`
- **AND** it SHALL create or refresh `<workspace-name>.code-workspace`
- **AND** it SHALL not create workspace ignore rules for machine-local open files by default

#### Scenario: Refreshing the open surface after linking
- **WHEN** `openspec workspace link` succeeds
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL refresh `AGENTS.md`
- **AND** it SHALL refresh `<workspace-name>.code-workspace`

#### Scenario: Refreshing the open surface after relinking
- **WHEN** `openspec workspace relink` succeeds
- **THEN** OpenSpec SHALL refresh `AGENTS.md`
- **AND** it SHALL refresh `<workspace-name>.code-workspace`

#### Scenario: Building the VS Code workspace file
- **WHEN** OpenSpec refreshes `<workspace-name>.code-workspace`
- **THEN** the file SHALL include every linked repo or folder with a valid local path before workspace-local files
- **AND** it SHALL include attached initiative context when available
- **AND** it SHALL include the workspace root as `OpenSpec workspace`
- **AND** it SHALL omit linked repos or folders whose local paths are missing or invalid

#### Scenario: Cleaning legacy workspace ignore rules
- **WHEN** OpenSpec refreshes the workspace open surface
- **THEN** it SHALL remove the legacy ignore rule for the maintained `<workspace-name>.code-workspace` file when present
- **AND** it SHALL preserve unrelated user-authored ignore rules

#### Scenario: Preserving user-authored AGENTS content
- **GIVEN** `AGENTS.md` contains content outside the OpenSpec workspace guidance markers
- **WHEN** OpenSpec refreshes workspace guidance
- **THEN** it SHALL replace only the marked OpenSpec workspace guidance block
- **AND** it SHALL preserve content outside the markers

#### Scenario: Appending AGENTS guidance when markers are missing
- **GIVEN** `AGENTS.md` exists and OpenSpec workspace guidance markers are absent
- **WHEN** OpenSpec refreshes workspace guidance
- **THEN** it SHALL append the marked OpenSpec workspace guidance block
- **AND** it SHALL preserve the existing file content
